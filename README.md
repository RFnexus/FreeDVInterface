FreeDVInterface 
-
This is a CustomInterface for Reticulum that provides a plug and play, cross-platform sound modem interface for HF radios using the FreeDV API.
It supports VOX, serial, and Hamilb PTT. The interface also provides highly configurable options for collision avoidance. 

âš  Work in progress

Setup and getting on the air
-
Example config with an ICOM-7300 and using rigctl over network with rigctld
```
[[FreeDVInterface IC-7300]]
    type = FreeDVInterface
    interface_enabled = True
    input_device = 2
    output_device = 2
    freedv_mode = datac1
    tx_volume = 100
    ptt_type = hamlib
    hamlib_network = True
    hamlib_host = localhost
    hamlib_port = 4532
    csma_enabled = True
```

## Troubleshooting
> I keep seeing "Invalid sample rate"

Ensure that you have the right audio devices configured

>I'm using a single board computer like the Raspberry Pi Zero and keep seeing "ALSA lib pcm.c:8526:(send_pcm_recover) underrun occured"

Ensure that your Pi / other SBC is getting enough power and that there are no issues with the USB soundcard or other USB device connected to your radio
