FreeDVInterface 
-
This is a CustomInterface for Reticulum that provides a plug and play, cross-platform sound modem interface for HF radios using the FreeDV API.
It supports VOX, serial, and Hamilb PTT. The interface also provides highly configurable options for collision avoidance. 

âš  Work in progress

Setup:
-

### Raspberry Pi (Zero, 4, 5) / Debian / Ubuntu


1. Build and install codec2:
```
sudo apt install git build-essential cmake
git clone https://github.com/drowe67/codec2
cd codec2
mkdir build_linux
cd build_linux
cmake ..
make
```

2. Install pre-requisites 
```
sudo apt install portaudio19-dev
pip install pyaudio OR sudo apt install python-pyaudio 
pip install numpy OR sudo apt install python-numpy

```
3. (Optional) install Hamlib for rigctl PTT support 
```
sudo apt install libhamlib-utils
```

4. Move FreeDVInterface.py to the "interfaces" folder in your Reticulum install location  
```
git clone https://github.com/RFnexus/FreeDVInterface.git
cd FreeDVInterface
mv FreeDVInterface.py ~/.reticulum/interfaces
```
5. Add a FreeDVInterface to your Reticulum config 

An example config looks like this. Here we are using `rigctld` to key on / off the PTT on a ICOM-7300. 

```
[[FreeDVInterface IC-7300]]
    type = FreeDVInterface
    interface_enabled = True
    input_device = 2
    output_device = 2
    freedv_mode = datac1
    tx_volume = 100
    ptt_type = hamlib
    hamlib_network = True
    hamlib_host = localhost
    hamlib_port = 4532
    csma_enabled = True
```

### Windows

`TODO`

### Fedora

`TODO`

## Troubleshooting
> I keep seeing "Invalid sample rate"

Ensure that you have the right audio devices configured

>I'm using a single board computer like the Raspberry Pi Zero and keep seeing "ALSA lib pcm.c:8526:(send_pcm_recover) underrun occured"

Ensure that your Pi / other SBC is getting enough power and that there are no issues with the USB soundcard or other USB device connected to your radio
